# AzFuncFizzBuzzDocker

Step by step writing an Azure Function and running it with Docker.

I will explain the basics of docker and Azure Functions, what do you need to install.

we will create an azure function and work with HTTPTrigger, using Visual Studio code to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
